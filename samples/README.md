# Samples

This folder contains small, self-contained files you can use to manually smoke-test Live UI Editor.

- HTML: `samples/html/sample-ui.html`
- React (TSX): `samples/react-tsx/SampleCards.tsx`
- React (JSX): `samples/react-jsx/SampleCards.jsx`

Tip: If no supported file is currently open, the extension will try to auto-open the default HTML sample.

How to try samples quickly:

1. Run **Live UI: Open**.
2. Choose **Static HTML / No dev server**.
3. Click **Try a sample**.
