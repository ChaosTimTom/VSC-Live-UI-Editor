## What Live UI Editor can edit

Live UI Editor has two workflows:

- **Static HTML Mode**: opens one `.html` file in the preview and writes edits directly back into that file.
- **App Mode (dev server)**: connects to a running dev server (Vite/Next/etc.), lets you edit the *real app UI*, and then writes those edits back to code.

If you don’t know which to pick, start with **Static HTML Mode**.
